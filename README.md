# UK Knifecrime Data Display

Test page available [here](https://liam-t.github.io/knifecrime-display/).

This project visualises the data created from my [knifecrime data repo](https://github.com/liam-t/knifecrime-data).

It shows data on recorded knifecrime incidents in the UK split by year and financial quarter.

It uses the [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3) libraries to plot the data and handle the user interaction, with various others such as [React Spring](https://github.com/react-spring/react-spring), [Flubber](https://github.com/veltman/flubber) and [React Select](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select) for animation/presentation etc.
